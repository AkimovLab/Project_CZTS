## Step 1 – Ground-State Molecular Dynamics

This step involves running ground-state molecular dynamics simulations using CP2K.  
The input file (`md.inp`) defines the simulation settings and parameters.  
`submit.slm` is the SLURM script used to submit the job to the CCR cluster.  
The initial structure file (`cu2snzns4.xyz`) contains the atomic coordinates.  
The results from this step will be used in the next stages for excited-state analysis.
